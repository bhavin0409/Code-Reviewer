# Code Reviewer Frontend

This is the frontend React application for the **Code Reviewer** project. It provides a user-friendly interface for submitting code snippets and receiving AI-powered code reviews in real time.

## Features

- **Live Code Editor:**  
  Write or paste your code in a syntax-highlighted editor powered by [react-simple-code-editor](https://github.com/satya164/react-simple-code-editor) and [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/).

- **AI Code Review:**  
  Submit your code to the backend with a single click and receive a detailed, Markdown-formatted review from an AI code reviewer.

- **Markdown Rendering:**  
  Reviews are rendered with [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) and syntax highlighting for easy reading.

- **Responsive, Modern UI:**  
  Clean, dark-themed layout with a split view for code input and review output.
